			Node-DBus
		</h1>
		<p>
			The node-dbus project is a simple light-weight NodeJS based wrapper over some libdbus api's which enables the developer to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>perform synchronous method-calls on a service provider
			</li>
			<li>perform asynchronous method-calls on a service provider
			</li>
			<li>send signals on the message bus
			</li>
			<li>listen to signals propagated over the message bus
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Note that it is not intended to be a full-blown one-to-one mapping of the libdbus api. For that, you might want to look at node-libdbus which is relatively concrete.
		</p>
		<p>
			Node-dbus provides a convenient Javascript object DBusMessage which is used to perform the afore-mentioned chores with some restrictions as mentioned under the relevant api description.
		</p>
		<p>
			It has currently been tested only on the 32-bit Ubuntu Lucid Lynx and 64-bit Fedora15 GNOME releases and thus should be good for other distributions too.
